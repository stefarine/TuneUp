# TuneUp

Tune Up is a dating website based on musical tastes. The project was realized within the context of the [Software Architecture](https://hecnet.unil.ch/hec/syllabus/descriptif/2458?dyn_lang=fr) course given by [prof. Beno√Æt Garbinato](https://hecnet.unil.ch/hec/recherche/fiche?pnom=bgarbinato&dyn_lang=fr). To carry out this project I used technologies such as Java, XML, MySql or JakartaEE. TuneUp has an MVC architecture (model/view/controller).

The project is divided into 4 phases. In the first phase, I imagined the application. I defined the different functions of the application and I schematized the database. Then I implemented a first basic version of the application where the views are in the terminal.
